# 2022_Masked Event Modeling: Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras

## Research Questions
The development of event-based vision has been hampered by the small amount of labeled event data compared to the vast majority of labeled RGB imagery.
## Motivations
Reduce the dependency on labeled event data
## Contributions
1. Masked Event Modeling (MEM) is introduced as a selfsupervised pretraining framework for events that pretrains a neural network on unlabeled events, making it applicable to any event recording.
2. Set a new state-of-the-art accuracy for image classification. N-Imagenet +7.96%, N-Cars +1.49%, and N-Caltech101 +9.5%.
3. It is not always standard protocol to transfer RGB pretrained weights to the event domain.
